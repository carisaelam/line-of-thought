## Setup Instructions

To get this project running on your local machine, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- **Ruby** (version 3.x)
- **Rails** (version 7.x)
- **Node.js**
- **Yarn**
- **PostgreSQL** (or your preferred database)
- **Redis** (if used)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/carisaelam/line-of-thought.git
   ```

2. **Navigate into the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd line-of-thought
   ```

3. **Install Ruby dependencies:**

   ```bash
   bundle install
   ```

4. **Install JavaScript dependencies:**

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

5. **Set up the database:**

   ```bash
   rails db:setup
   ```

   If you encounter errors related to existing records, you can reset the database:

   ```bash
   rails db:drop db:create db:migrate db:seed
   ```

   **Note**: If the seed file causes issues due to existing records, the `db:drop` command will delete all existing data. Adjust the seed file to handle duplicates if necessary.

6. **Precompile assets** (optional, typically for production):

   ```bash
   rails assets:precompile
   ```

7. **Run the development server:**

   ```bash
   rails server
   ```

8. **Open your browser**:
   Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the application.
